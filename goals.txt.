My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
Next year, I aim to stay consistent in my studies, manage my time better, and improve in subjects I find challenging. I’ll focus on being more organized, asking for help when needed, and staying curious beyond the classroom.
Personally, I want to build healthier habits, become more disciplined, and grow emotionally by improving my confidence and communication. Overall, I’m committed to steady growth and becoming a better version of myself.
